            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>Retrieval Practice is the act of remembering something or “bringing it to mind” as learning scientists say.
               This could be simply trying to write down everything you know about a subject on a blank page, or taking a practice test
                or using flash cards (if done correctly).
                The key is to not use notes or readings and just try to remember on your own.</p>
                <p>Research has shown this to be one of the most effective study techniques.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Stronger Connections:</b> the process of searching your memory for an item makes it easier to find that memory later. It’s like there is a path through the jungle to the thing you want to remember,
                and each time go down the path it gets clearer and easier to follow.</li>
              <li><b>	More Refined:</b> each time you access your memory it changes a bit and
                 gets better organized and stored in your memory.</li>
              <li><b>More Connections:</b> our memories are connected to each other and the more we access them</li>
              <li><b>	Know what you know and don’t’ know:</b> going through the process shows you want you remember and what you don’t,
                so you know what you need to work on.</li>
